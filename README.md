# How eBPF Actually Works Sample Code

This is sample code for my talk "How eBPF Actually Works".

The eBPF code is based on the "minimal" example from [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap/).

Please do not use this code as the basis of an eBPF application. Use [a library](https://ebpf.io) instead.
